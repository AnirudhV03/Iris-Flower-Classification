# Iris-Flower-Classification

**Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning Algorithms.**

I built this model using Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree Classifier algorithms to classify iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica species based on their sepal and petal measurements. It is a fantastic example of how machine learning can be applied to real-world problems, and is a great starting point for anyone interested in the field.
